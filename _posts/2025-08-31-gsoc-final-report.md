Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I had a great experience participating in this yearâ€™s Google Summer of Code (GSoC) with LibreOffice.  
It's a great experience to collaborate with people from all over the world, contribute to an open-source project, and learned a lot along the way.

## Overview
This [project](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/GSoC/Ideas#New_dialog_to_edit_Table_Styles) is about creating a new dialog to edit **Table Styles** (actually autoformats, which are predefined templates). The dialog was based on the UX team's [proposal](https://design.blog.documentfoundation.org/2015/12/13/style-your-tables/).

**Current Limitations**:
-  In both Writer and Calc, users could not edit an existing table style. The only option was to [format](https://books.libreoffice.org/en/WG76/WG7613-Tables.html#toc27) a table manually and then save it as a new style, but that's not very intuitive.
- Even though the underlying data structure for autoformats is similar in Writer and Calc, each has its own implementation, including a separate "AutoFormat Dialog".
- Autoformats are stored in a binary file which was hard to maintain and not backwards compatible.
- Applying autoformat did not follow the ODF(Open Document Format) specification.

### Project Outcomes
**AutoFormat Dialog**: Now the dialog is shared between Writer and Calc. Nothing is changed visually except the addition of *New Style* and *Edit Style* buttons.

**Table Style Dialog**:
- Added inheritance feature to table styles, every style by default inherits from *Default Style*.
- Users can customize styles for 16 elements (first-row, last-row, body, etc). The styles are applied according to ODF priority.

**Adapting ODF specification**:
Table Styles are now applied according to element priority.
For example:
- The first row of a table is formatted by the style in *first-row* element.
- If no background color is defined, it falls back to the *odd-row* style.
- If that is also undefined, it falls back to the *body* style, and so on.

**Styles Sidebar**: We can edit/create table styles from the Styles Sidebar in Writer.

## Technical Details
Although the project is about creating a dialog, the hardest part was unifying the autoformat code from Writer and Calc. Writer and Calc have `SwTableAutoFormatTable` and `ScAutoFormat` classes, respectively for handling autoformats, which are required for table styling. I created a new `SvxAutoFormat` class which combines the common functionality of Writer and Calc. Now this new class is inherited by both Writer and Calc classes.

**Loading Table Styles**: Becasue we wanted to replace the old binary file for loading/storing table styles, I created an XML file ('tablestyles.xml') based on existing table styles which are shipped with LibreOffice. I created `SvxTableStylesImport` class which is used to load styles to `SvxAutoFormat` and `SvxTableStylesExport` class to save the `SvxAutoFormat` to the XML file.

**Other Improvements**:
- New tables are created with *Default Style* by default. There is no longer a style called 'None' in the 'AutoFormat Dialog'.
- Bugs related to autoformat have been fixed
  - [Writer:Insert Table with style still directly applies Liberation Serif 12](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121023)
  - [Inserting or removing a row/column changes entire table's formatting](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126008)
  - [if you add rows/columns to a 1x1 table, the cell borders are not displayed](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166223)(Because by default every new table has *Default Style*)

**Related Patches**:
- [SvxAutoFormat and dialogs](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/190024/)
- [Adapting Writer](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/190024/10)
- [Adapting Calc](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/190026)

### What's Left
- Add WYSIWYG preview of table styles in the Writer styles sidebar.
- Add UI tests to verify the workflow.

### Limitations
- **Backward compatibility**: Old `.odt` files open correctly, but since the internal structure of table styles has changed to follow ODF, when you interact with the table (inserting/deleting rows/columns), the style of the table changes.
- **Number formatting** in the Table Styles dialog is not yet functional (planned fix).

### Future Scope
- In Impress, the Table styles panel has checkboxes to enable/disable certain element styles, I have already implemented the backend functionality, depending on the UX team's approval, this can be added to the new dialog or sidebar.
